Pier One - STUPS' Docker Registry
=================================

Docker registry with immutable tags, repo permissions, S3 backend and OAuth.

Development
===========

The service is written in Clojure. You need Leiningen_ installed to build or develop.

To start a web server for the application, you need a running PostgreSQL instance on localhost with empty pierone database
(postgres/postgres as user/pass).
Run the development web server with:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ lein repl
    (go)

The web server will run on port 8080. You can find the Swagger UI on http://localhost:8080/ui/.

Testing with different client versions
--------------------------------------

Use docker in docker: https://hub.docker.com/r/library/docker/

For example:

```sh
# First push the image
$ docker push my-machine-hostname:8080/foo/bar:123
# Try to pull it using a specific version of docker (1.11)
# Start the daemon
$ docker run -it --privileged --name docker11 -d docker:1.11-dind --insecure-registry my-machine-hostname:8080
# Execute the command
$ docker run -it --rm --link docker11:docker docker:1.11 docker pull my-machine-hostname:8080/foo/bar:123
# ... execute more commands
# Stop the daemon
$ docker rm -fv docker11
```

Testing
=======

Running unit tests with code coverage report:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ lein cloverage

.. code-block:: bash

    $ docker pull busybox
    $ docker tag busybox localhost:8080/example/foobar:1.0
    $ docker push localhost:8080/example/foobar:1.0
    $ docker pull localhost:8080/example/foobar:1.0

Building
========

.. code-block:: bash

    $ lein do uberjar, scm-source, docker build

Running
=======

Pier One supports a number of environment variables to use the Amazon S3 backend.
You will need a PostgreSQL database (database schemas are created automatically on first start).

.. code-block:: bash

    # run Pier One locally with file backend and connect to localhost PostgreSQL
    # NOTE: we simply use the "host" networking hack here to connect to the localhost DB
    $ docker run -it -p 8080:8080 --net=host stups/pierone

``DB_SUBNAME``
    Postgres connection string, e.g "//pierone.foo.eu-west-1.rds.amazonaws.com:5432/pierone?ssl=true". Default is "//localhost:5432/pierone"
``DB_PASSWORD``
    Postgres password. Default is "postgres".
``DB_USER``
    Postgres user name. Default is "postgres".
``HTTP_ALLOW_PUBLIC_READ``
    Allow Docker image downloads without authentication (e.g. to run Pier One as a registry for open source projects). Default is "false".
``HTTP_TEAM_SERVICE_URL``
    URL to get team membership information by user's UID.
``HTTP_TOKENINFO_URL``
    OAuth2 token info URL (e.g. https://example.org/oauth2/tokeninfo). You can leave away this configuration property to disable OAuth authentication.
``HTTP_IIDINFO_URL``
    IID info URL for checking AWS Instance Identity Document based authorization. Only is enabled when ``HTTP_TOKENINFO_URL`` is also set.
``PGSSLMODE``
    Set to "verify-full" in order to fully verify the Postgres SSL cert.
``STORAGE_S3_BUCKET``
    Only for S3 backend: the Amazon S3 bucket name.
``NREPL_ENABLED``
    Set to ``true`` to start NREPL server before starting the application. Default is ``false``.
``NREPL_PORT``
    Specify the port for NREPL server. Default is random port.
``API_SNS_REGION``
    SNS topic region (notifications on pushed tags)
``API_SNS_TOPIC_ARN``
    SNS topic arn (notifications on pushed tags)

See the `STUPS Installation Guide section on Pier One`_ for details about deploying Pier One into your AWS account.

Security
========

Pier One uses OAuth 2 to protect its resources. The current implementation assumes:

* OAuth token information contains the ``uid`` field with the user's ID (e.g. "jdoe")
* The user's team membership can be looked up in the team service
* Authenticated users are allowed to pull all Docker images
* Authenticated users are allowed to push to their team's repository only

As Docker CLI only supports Basic authentication, Pier One uses a special username:

.. code-block::

    oauth2:OAUTH2_TOKEN_GOES_HERE

This string has to be encoded by base64 and put into ``~/.docker/config.json``:

.. code-block:: json

    {
      "auths": {
        "pierone.example.org": {
          "email": "no-mail-required@example.org",
          "auth": "BASE64_ENCODED_AUTH_STRING"
        }
      }
    }

Additionally, to support image pulling from known AWS EC2 machines, Instance Identity Document (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-identity-documents.html)
 can be used to authenticate instead of OAuth2 token, it also uses a special username:

.. code-block::

    instance-identity-document:MIAGCSqG ... AAAAAAA

The ``MIAG...`` string can be obtained from EC2 instance profile under ``http://169.254.169.254/latest/dynamic/instance-identity/pkcs7``.
It's not a common use case, but Pier One CLI API can be used to generate ``~/.docker/config.json``:

.. code-block:: bash

    python3 -c "from pierone.api import docker_login_with_iid; docker_login_with_iid('pierone.example.org')"


The `Pier One CLI`_ allows configuring the Docker client with the appropriate auth credentials.
